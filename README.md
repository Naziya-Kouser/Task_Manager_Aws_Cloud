# Task_Manager_Aws_Cloud
I created a Task Manager website using Python (Flask) and hosted it on the AWS Cloud. It allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. Tasks are stored using SQLite, and the app features a clean UI for efficient task management. It ensures simple and effective to-do list handling online.
